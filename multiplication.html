    <b><em>Question</em></b>: There are three types of shoes: boots, sneakers, and dress shoes.
    Each shoe comes in two colors, black or brown. How many possible shoe configurations are there?
    </p>
    <p>
    <b><em>Solution</em></b>: First we must make our first choice, C<sub>1</sub>,
    which is the type of shoe. Then our second choice, C<sub>2</sub>, is what color of shoe.
    The outcome of C<sub>1</sub> contains four possibilities, |O<sub>1</sub>| = 3,
    and the outcome of C<sub>2</sub> contains 2 possibilities, |O<sub>2</sub>| = 2.
    Now we apply the multiplication rule: Total number of outcomes
    = |O<sub>1</sub>| x |O<sub>2</sub>| = 3 x 2 = 6. Therefore there are 6 total
    shoe configurations.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Multiplication Rule</b>: If we have two choices C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>,
    with C<sub>1</sub> having possible outcomes O<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>
    having possible outcomes O<sub>2</sub>, with |O<sub>1</sub>| = n<sub>1</sub>
    and |O<sub>2</sub>| = n<sub>2</sub>, then the total number of possible outcomes
    associated with C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> occurring is n<sub>1</sub> x n<sub>2</sub>.
    More generally, if we have k choices C<sub>1</sub>, ... , C<sub>k</sub>
    having n<sub>1</sub>, ... , n<sub>k</sub> possible outcomes, then the total number
    of ways of C<sub>1</sub> occurring and C<sub>2</sub> occurring and ... and C<sub>k</sub>
    occurring is n<sub>1</sub> x n<sub>2</sub> x ... x n<sub>k</sub>.
    </p>

    In combinatorics, the multiplication rule is stated simply as the idea that if
    there are a ways of doing something and b ways of doing another thing, then there
    are a x b ways of performing both actions.
