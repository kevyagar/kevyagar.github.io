A simple website made in my first year of college with my partner. The objective was to create an educational webpage based on one of the topics we have learned about in class (Discrete Structures)

Key things we learnt as a result of this project: learning how to code in HTML, Javascript implementation, embedding videos, and images, and flow of navigation through the website.
