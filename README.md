A simple website made in my first year of college with my partner. Objective was to create an educational webpage based off one of the topics we have learned about in class (Discrete Structures)

Key things we learnt as a result of this project: learning how to code in HTML, Javascript implemntation, embedding videos and images, flow of navigation through the website.
