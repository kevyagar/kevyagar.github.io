    <h3 style="line-height: 0.002;">What are Counting Numbers?</h3>
    <p style="line-height:1.0"> <em>Counting, Combinatorics, Real World Applications/Uses</em></p>
    <p>Counting numbers sounds like exactly what it's about, counting numbers. We use combinatorics to help us with counting, and this can be referred to as "enumerative combinatorics." </p>
    <p>Combinatorics are useful when we try to figure out the number of possible outcomes based on the number of decisions. 
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps best used today by social media to find connections with people we do not directly know, like for example Instagram. You have followers, and those followers have their own followers, and those followers have their own followers and so on. Combinatorics in this case is used to help you find people who you can follow based off various things, such as mutual followers. 
    </p>
    <p>Combinatorics are also used in probability to discover the chance of getting a desired outcome.

    <h2><b>Combinatorics</b></h2>
    <p><b>Combinatorics</b>: The branch of mathematics dealing with combinations of objects belonging to a finite set in accordance with certain constraints, such as those of graph theory.

    <h2>Addition Rule</h2>
     <p><b><em>Question</em></b>: You want to buy a cell phone, the local verizon store has three iPhone 11’s on sale (black, white, purple) and two Samsung Galaxy 10’s on sale (black, white). How many possible ways are there to pick a phone?</p>
     <p><b><em>Solution</em></b>: You can purchase either an iPhone 11 or a Samsung Galaxy 10. Since there are three ways to pick an iPhone and two ways to pick a Samsung Galaxy 10 there are five ways to pick a phone (3+2=5)</p>
     <p><b>Addition Rule</b>: If we have two choices C1 and C2, with C1 having possible outcomes O1 and C2 having possible outcomes O2, with |O1| =n1 and |O2| =n2, then if the sets O1 and O2 are disjoint (non-overlapping) the total number of outcomes for C1 or C2 having n1,..., nk possible (non-overlapping) outcomes, then the total number of ways of C1 occurring or C2 occuring or Ck occuring is n1+n2+.....+nk.
    </p>
     <p>This rule is used when we have several possible choices but will only make one of them, the multiplication rule is used when we have several choices and must make all of them.</p>
