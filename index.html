    <p style="color:#ffa366;;"> <em>Counting, Combinatorics, Real World Applications/Uses</em></p>
    <p style="color:white;;"> Counting numbers sounds like exactly what it's about, counting numbers. We use combinatorics to help us with counting, and this can be referred to as "enumerative combinatorics." </p>
    <p style="color:white;;"> Combinatorics is useful when we try to figure out the number of possible outcomes based on the number of decisions. 
    </p>
    <p style="color:white;">Perhaps best used today in social media to find connections with people we do not directly know, for example Instagram. You have followers, and those followers have their own followers, and those followers have their own followers and so on. Combinatorics in this case is used to help you find people who you can follow based off various things, such as mutual followers. 
    </p>
    <p style="color:white;">Combinatorics is also used in probability to discover the chance of getting a desired outcome.
