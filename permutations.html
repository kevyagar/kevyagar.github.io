    <b><em>Question</em></b>: You want to place 4 students in 4 seats.
    How many different ways can their seating be arranged?
    </p>
    <p>
    <b><em>Solution</em></b>: There are 4 students, there's 4 kids who can sit in
    the first seat. After, there are now 3 students to pick from for the second seat,
    once a student is selected for the second seat, then now there is only two students
    left for the third seat and after that seating is done, there's one student left for
    the last seat. There are 24 ways of seating the students, 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.
    </p>

    <b>Permutation</b>: A permutation of objects is an arrangement of those objects
    where order does matter. For example a pass code of 1234 is different from a pass
    code of 4321. Even though both codes contain the same numbers (1234) they are not
    the same because the order of those numbers are different. Also, each object can only
    be used once in the permutation.

    The formula for calculating the number of permutations for r items chosen from a total
    of n items is denoted P(n, r). So the number of ways to permute four students into four
    chairs would be P(4, 4). The formula for calculating P(n, r) is given above, by plugging in
    n as 4 and r as 4, you will get 24.
